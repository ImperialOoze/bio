 				<h3>Who is she?</h3>
 				<p>The most Important Person to me is my mother. She supports my ideas for my future and truly believes in me. I live a pretty solitary life-style which leads to me not really interacting much with people. When I got my job, there would be somedays where I would never see her. Having someone who would call me just so they could see me, really made me feel good. That and how she genuinly cares about me and trusts me is what sets her apart from the rest.</p>

 				<h3>My childhood</h3>
 				<p>I  lived in a small house in Jackson Mississippi for the beginning of my life. You may not believe it but when I was young, I was a very different person. Many of my characteristcs I had now were there but not nearly as visible. I was much more talkative and very trusting. I went outside practicly everyday and talked to my family members naturally (not as though they were strangers).</p>

 				<h3>My Choice</h3>
 				<p>When choosing my inspirational person, it came down to 3 family members. My mom, my sister, and my grandmother. When I talk to any of them I don't feel like i'm an enigma to them. They understand me and don't think i'm the black sheep of the family.</p>

 				<h3>Relations</h3>
 				<p>One of my earliest memories of my Uncle Head (he's a barber) is when he was arguing with my other uncle on how to raise me at his barber shop. Head wanted me to get into sports and be the typical kid. My other Uncle wanted me to follow what I wanted and said good I was with computers so he believed I was on a good path.</p>

         	<h3>My Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Out of all her siblings my mother is the only one who went to college and got a degree. She is the only one who got out of the hood and got her self kids who all have a bright future because of her hardwork and dedication. I hope to eventually have kids and get married. I want to be as successful as my mom when it comes to raising them.</p>
